            <h1>Foods</h1>
            <p>If you've come looking for my favourite food then this is the correct place. My country, Nepal, has a lot of delicious street foods however, I want to show you more foods from different places. Let's take a look at the foods I like. There
                are a total of 6 different foods to look from. They are all mouth-watering and come from different regions of the world. I love all of them equally and I hope you like them too.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>What's tastier than a double fried, thick battered, crip exterior and juicy fried chicken? Nothing comes to mind. Let's not look at calories for a second here ;)</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>If I could bake, I'd make 100 brownies and manage to eat them within a single day. My 9-year-old cousin nicknamed me 'Prownie' because it rhymes with brownie. They're both sweet
