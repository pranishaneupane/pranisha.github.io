Hey guys! I am Pranisha Neupane. Glad you found your way around here.
This is a webpage I created as an assignment for Web Technologies (ADM6012) module.
It is dedicated towards the foods that I like. I have included 6 different foods that I like.
The page contains:
1. A background image that covers the whole page,
2. A logo which is just a text in fancy font style,
3. A menu button which opens up and shows 3 different buttons (About- Opens an about page about me, Foods- Opens a separate page with foods and description, Contact me- Opens up my LinkedIn page),
4. A heading which basically is the title of my web page,
5. A paragraph which welcomes visiters and talks a little about the web page,
6. An 'Explore with me' button,
7. Another heading for the food section,
8. Six images of different foods aligned in neat rows and columns,
9. A hover effect on the images which then shows a gradient overlay,
10. Food names and a little description which becomes visible when hovered around the image, and
11. A little footer thanking everyone and giving credits to everyone who deserved it.

Images of food are colorful on itself so no matter how hard one tries, it would look messy. 
To tackle this, a dark colored image was used as background. This has made the design look clean.

For a responsive navigation bar, script and function were used.

Small comments have been added on each section to indicate what the codes on that section do.
It's been done for both html and css codes.

I have taken help from:
1. VU collaborate in understanding the elements of coding,
2. YouTube tutorials for fancy elements that has been added,
3. ChatGPT for checking errors on parts of the codes,
4. Color space for color pallet used in the design,
5. Freepik for the images used, and
6. My friends who supplied me with moral support.
   
Thank you very much for visiting my repository :)
